## Start of writeup

### Introduction
This CTF is one of the first CTFs I've done whilst diving deeper into cybersecurity, it's a very simple, and beginner friendly CTF which serves the purpose of showing basic tools used to ennumerate a network and target. 

### Goal of the CTF
The goal of this CTF is to remotely attack the Virtual Machine and gain root access/privileges. 

### Gaining root access
Since there's only one goal during this CTF challenge, gaining root access of the VM, the goal is simple. The first step is to ennumerate the network and the target. Enumeration is the process of gaining more knowledge about the target you're attacking. Think about things like user names, machine names, network resources, open ports, versions of services running on the system. With the information gathered in this phase weak points of the system are exposed and points of entry are established.

The enumeration process during this CTF consisted of doing a [Netdiscover](https://kalilinuxtutorials.com/netdiscover-scan-live-hosts-network/) scan to see what the IP address is of the VM machine. 

```python
netdiscover -r 192.168.0.0
```

The scan returns the IP adress of 192.168.0.16, this will be the IP we'll be working with. The next step is to do an NMAP scan, NMAP is a scanning tool which allows us to map out the ports used on the target, what they're running and what version of it is running. For more information about NMAP, the different flags etc, visit [the NMAP website](https://nmap.org). For our CTF we use the following command:

```python
nmap -sC -sV -sS -AT4 192.168.0.16
```
